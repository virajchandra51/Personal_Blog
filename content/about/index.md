For most period of high school / senior school, I have studied and inscribed the sacred runes and performed thearcane rituals that breathe life into the realm of the Internet. I hope and brag to conjure a website from nothing into existence, fully formed, before any of my peers. I do not use tricks, nor is this magic.

I'm currently studying and future graduating from National Institute Of Technology, Raipur, with Bachelors In Information Technology.
